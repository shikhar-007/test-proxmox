# Security Cleanup Summary

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Classification**: Security Review and Remediation  
**Status**: Remediation Complete - Action Required

## Executive Summary

During pre-deployment review, we identified that production credentials were inadvertently committed to the repository. This document details the findings, remediation actions taken, and required follow-up procedures.

## Findings

### Critical Security Issues Identified

The following files contained production credentials that should never be stored in version control:

1. `.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md` - Production Proxmox IP, passwords, and SSH credentials in documentation examples
2. `milestone1-packer/test.hcl` - Test configuration containing actual credentials
3. `milestone1-packer/environments/dev.tfvars` - Development environment configuration with production credentials
4. `milestone1-packer/environments/prod.tfvars` - Production environment configuration  
5. `milestone2-hardening/inventory.ini` - Ansible inventory with VM IP address and authentication password
6. `milestone3-terraform/test.tfvars` - Terraform test configuration with production values

### Exposed Information

The following production credentials were present in the repository:

- **Proxmox Server IP**: `74.96.90.38`
- **Proxmox Root Password**: `1qaz@WSX3edc$RFV`
- **SSH Password**: `My!temp@123#456`
- **Node Identifier**: `tcnhq-prxmx01`
- **VM IP Address**: `192.168.0.41`

## Remediation Actions Completed

### 1. File Removal

Removed all test and environment-specific files containing credentials:

```
milestone1-packer/test.hcl
milestone1-packer/environments/dev.tfvars
milestone1-packer/environments/prod.tfvars
milestone1-packer/environments/ (directory)
milestone3-terraform/test.tfvars
milestone3-terraform/.terraform/ (provider binaries)
```

### 2. File Sanitization

Updated the following files to use placeholder values instead of production credentials:

- `.github/SECRETS_SETUP.md` - Replaced actual values with `YOUR_PASSWORD` placeholders
- `milestone2-hardening/inventory.ini` - Changed to template format with `YOUR_VM_IP` examples

### 3. Enhanced .gitignore Rules

Added protective rules to prevent future credential exposure:

```gitignore
.terraform/
.terraform.lock.hcl
test.hcl
**/environments/*.tfvars
inventory.ini.local
```

These rules ensure local configuration files are not tracked by version control.

## Current Repository State

The repository now contains only safe, production-ready code:

**Core Documentation**
- README.md - Project overview and documentation index

- Inventory template requiring user customization

**Terraform Deployment** (milestone3-terraform/)
- Complete Terraform infrastructure code
- Interactive deployment automation
- Single-VM and multi-VM example configurations

## Required Actions

### Immediate Security Response

**Priority 1: Credential Rotation**

The exposed credentials must be changed immediately:

1. **Proxmox Root Password**
   ```bash
   # On Proxmox host
   passwd
   ```

2. **VM SSH Passwords**
   ```bash
   # On each VM
   ssh rocky@<VM_IP>
   passwd
   ```

3. **Template 108 Password**
   - Boot template VM
   - Reset rocky user password
   - Shut down and re-convert to template

**Priority 2: Access Log Review**

Before changing passwords, review system logs for unauthorized access attempts:

```bash
# Proxmox authentication logs
grep "authentication failure" /var/log/auth.log
grep "Accepted password" /var/log/auth.log

# Proxmox API access
grep "authentication failure" /var/log/daemon.log

# VM SSH access logs
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
sudo grep "Accepted password" /var/log/auth.log
```

Document any suspicious activity for incident response procedures.

### Security Enhancements

While rotating credentials, implement these additional security measures:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Enable 2FA on Proxmox web interface
   - Configure TOTP or hardware token authentication

2. **Network Access Controls**
   - Restrict Proxmox API access by source IP
   - Implement firewall rules for port 8006
   - Configure VPN requirements for administrative access

3. **SSH Hardening**
   - Prefer SSH key authentication over passwords
   - Disable password authentication where possible
   - Implement fail2ban or similar brute-force protection

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Configure alerts for failed authentication attempts
   - Implement log aggregation and analysis
   - Set up automated security scanning

## Git History Considerations

### The Challenge

While we've removed credentials from current files, they remain in Git commit history. Anyone with access to previous commits can potentially view these credentials.

### Resolution Options

**Option 1: Accept and Mitigate** (Simplest)
- Change all exposed passwords immediately
- Use completely different passwords (not variations)
- Monitor for suspicious access
- Accept that historical commits contain old credentials

**Option 2: Create Fresh Repository** (Recommended)
- Create new GitHub repository
- Copy only current, cleaned code
- Push to new repository
- Archive or delete old repository
- Advantages: Complete clean slate, no historical exposure

**Option 3: Rewrite Git History** (Advanced)
- Use `git filter-repo` to remove credential traces
- Force-push to overwrite history
- Requires coordination with all repository users
- Risk of breaking existing clones
- Only recommended if you have Git history rewriting experience

**Recommendation**: Option 2 (fresh repository) provides the cleanest solution with minimal risk.

## Prevention Measures

### Developer Guidelines

1. **Never commit production credentials**
   - Use `YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE` in example files
   - Verify `.gitignore` rules before committing
   - Review `git diff` output carefully

2. **Use environment-based configuration**
   - Export variables for local testing
   - Avoid creating configuration files with real credentials
   - Use GitHub Secrets for automation

3. **Pre-commit verification**
   - Review all files before committing
   - Use git hooks to scan for potential secrets
   - Implement automated secret scanning tools

### Operational Guidelines

1. **GitHub Secrets for automation**
   - Store all credentials in GitHub Secrets
   - Never log or expose secret values
   - Rotate secrets on regular schedule

2. **Local configuration management**
   - Copy `.example` files and customize locally
   - Never commit customized configuration files
   - Use separate passwords per environment

3. **Regular credential rotation**
   - Quarterly password changes minimum
   - Immediate rotation when personnel changes occur
   - Document rotation in change management system

## Configuration Simplification

### Changes Made

**Previous Approach**: Multiple environment-specific folders (dev, staging, prod)
**Current Approach**: Single example file with local customization

This simplification:
- Reduces credential exposure surface area
- Simplifies configuration management
- Decreases likelihood of committing sensitive data
- Maintains flexibility through local customization

### Benefits

- One `terraform.tfvars.example` to maintain
- Local `.tfvars` files protected by `.gitignore`
- GitHub Actions handles automation securely
- Clearer workflow for users

## Current Status

**Completed**:
- All credential-containing files removed or sanitized
- Enhanced `.gitignore` rules implemented
- Documentation updated with placeholders
- Configuration approach simplified

**Pending Action**:
- Password rotation (requires immediate attention)
- Access log review and analysis
- Git history remediation decision
- GitHub Secrets update (after password changes)

## Follow-Up Checklist

Before considering this issue closed:

- [ ] Proxmox root password changed
- [ ] All VM SSH passwords changed
- [ ] Template 108 password updated
- [ ] Access logs reviewed for suspicious activity
- [ ] Git history remediation approach decided and implemented
- [ ] GitHub Secrets updated with new credentials

## Support and Questions

### If You Need to Change Passwords

1. Change Proxmox credentials first (maintain administrative access)
2. Update VM passwords systematically
3. Modify Template 108 before creating new VMs
4. Update GitHub Secrets last (after verifying new credentials work)

### If You Need to Clean Git History

Do not attempt Git history rewriting without prior experience. The process can corrupt repository history and affect all users. Creating a fresh repository is safer and simpler in most cases.

### If You're Uncertain About Next Steps

1. Change the exposed passwords (non-negotiable)
2. Review access logs for security incidents
3. Choose Git history remediation approach
4. Update GitHub Secrets if using automation
5. Test a deployment to verify everything functions correctly
